# Simple_text_area
This project is a simple web-based tool that allows users to type a message inside a text area while displaying a real-time character counter. The counter updates dynamically as the user types, showing both the number of characters typed and the number of characters remaining. It also prevents typing beyond the maximum limit and displays a warning message when the user reaches it.

ðŸš€ Features

Live character count: Updates instantly as the user types.

Character limit enforcement: Prevents typing beyond the specified maximum (default: 200 characters).

Warning message: Displays a visual alert when the limit is reached.
